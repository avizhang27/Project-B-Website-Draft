    <p>this project was meant to be my attempt at making students engaged and entertained by things that are school related in this hellish time at the end of the semester.</p>

    <p>we're all tired, sleep deprived, and that makes things get WEIRD - i aimed to capture that type of exhausted disorientation in a humorous, uncanny way so we can treat it like just another interactive game.</p>
  
    <p>"normal" things like using the elevator, walking to the bus and taking (the third? seventh?) quiz of the week take on a new mood within this world. </p>
